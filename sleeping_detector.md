## Facial Feature Detection Using Haar Cascade

The diagram above visualizes how facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth are detected using Haar-like features in a Haar Cascade algorithm. This process is essential for:

1. **Detecting the Position of a Face**: The Haar Cascade algorithm scans the image to locate the position of a face based on the identified features.
2. **Classifying Sleep Status**: Once the face is detected, the algorithm can analyze the state of the eyes to classify whether a person is asleep or awake.


- **Eyes**: The presence or absence of open eyes is a critical factor in determining if a person is sleeping.
- **Nose**: Helps in accurately positioning the face and recognizing facial orientation.
- **Mouth**: Also plays a role in understanding the overall facial expression.

If we did this in Google Colab, the code will come like this.

after this webcam capture a image,then run the below code,

We can detect whether it is sleeping or awakeðŸ˜Š
