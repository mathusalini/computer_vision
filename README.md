### Deep Learning in Computer Vision
Deep learning has significantly improved computer vision capabilities. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for tasks like:

- **Image Classification**: Assigning a label to an image based on its content.
- **Object Detection**: Identifying and locating objects within an image.
- **Facial Recognition**: Recognizing or verifying a person based on their facial features.
